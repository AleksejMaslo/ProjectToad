                                    to arrive on the world scene and short-lived in comparison to dwarves, elves, and
                                    dragons. Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that they strive to achieve as
                                    much as they can in the years they are given. Or maybe they feel they have something
                                    to prove to the elder races, and that’s why they build their mighty empires on the
                                    foundation of conquest and trade. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators,
                                    the achievers, and the pioneers o<span>f the worlds.</span></p>

                                <p>With their penchant for migration and conquest, humans are more physically diverse
                                    than other common races. There is no typical human. An individual can stand from 5
                                    feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds. Human skin
                                    shades range from nearly black to very pale, and hair colors from black to blond
                                    (curly, kinky, or straight); males might sport facial hair that is sparse or thick.
                                    A lot of humans have a dash of nonhuman blood, revealing hints of elf, orc, or other
                                    lineages. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and rarely live even a si<span>ngle century.</span>

                                <p>Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races. They have
                                    widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands where they
                                    have settled. When they settle, though, they stay: they build cities to last for the
                                    ages, and great kingdoms that can persist for long centuries. An individual human
                                    might have a relatively short life span, but a human nation or culture preserves
                                    traditions with origins far beyond the reach of any single human’s memory. They live
                                    fully in the present—making them well suited to the adventuring life—but also plan
                                    for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy. Individually and as a group,
                                    humans are adaptable opportunists, and they stay alert to changing political and soc<span>ial dynamics.<br></span>

                                    purposes. While dwarf clans and halfling elders pass on the ancient traditions to

                                    power, wealth, and fame. More than other people, humans champion causes rather than

                                    Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced more or less correctly), but most parents give names

                                <p>The material culture and physical characteristics of humans can change wildly from

                                    cuisine, music, and literature are different in the northwestern lands of the Silver
                                    Marches than in distant Turmish or Impiltur to the east—and even more distinctive in
                                    far-off Kara-Tur. Human physical characteristics, though, vary according to the
                                    ancient migrations of the earliest humans, so that the humans of the Silver Marches

                                    typical names of their members, can be used as inspiration no matter which world

                                        <p>House Cannith dominates all forms of manufacturing, both mystical and
                                            mundane. Cannith forgeholds use streamlined forms of production to quickly
                                            produce common goods. Even independent artisans often learn their trade at
                                            Cannith academies and adhere to Cannith standards. The House of Making
                                            builds the tools the other houses rely upon, and it has always been the
                                            unspoken leader of the Twelve.</p>
                                        <p>The Last War was a time of great opportunity for Cannith. Every nation wanted
                                            weapons and warforged, along with mundane arms and armor. The war raised the
                                            house up, and then tore it down. House Cannith was based in Cyre, and the
                                            Mourning destroyed the house leadership and key facilities. Now three barons
                                            jockey to fill the leadership vacuum: the alchemist Jorlanna of Fairhaven,
                                            weaponsmith Zorlan of Korth, and warforged innovator Merrix of Sharn. It
                                            remains to be seen whether one of these leaders will unite the house, or if
                                            it will shatter under the strain. If you’re an heir of House Cannith, you
                                            should decide which of these barons you serve — or if you have other ideas
                                            about the future of the house.</p>

                                        <p>The Mark of Handling gives its bearer a primal connection to beasts and the

                                        <h3 id="HouseVadalis">House Vadalis</h3>
                                        <p>House Vadalis plays an important role in daily life. Vadalis ranches produce
                                            meat, mounts, and more. Vadalis isn’t one of the most powerful houses, but
                                            its barons are generally content; they’re more interested in discovering new
                                            monstrosities than engaging in the politics of the Dragonmarked Houses.</p>
                                        <p>House Vadalis breeds and trains beasts for a wide range of purposes. While
                                            they maintain vast cattle ranches and train horses and hounds, the Mark of
                                            Handling allows Vadalis to work with more exotic creatures as well.
                                            Griffons, hippogriffs, and even bullettes can be bred and trained. Vadalis
                                            also works with more intelligent beasts, such as giant owls, displacers
                                            beasts, and pegasi. Even with the Mark of Handling, this is dangerous work;
                                            there’s a lot of turnover at the bullette ranch. But these exotic creatures
                                            aren’t enough to satisfy the most innovative members of the house, and this
                                            has led to the practice of&nbsp;<strong>magebreeding</strong>. Using the
                                            Mark of Handling and dragonshard focus items, Vadalis has found ways to
                                            create magical creatures. Typically, this results in a superior version of a
                                            mundane creature — an animal that is stronger, faster, and smarter. But
                                            rumors claim that Vadalis has crafted monsters of its own. Some rumors even
                                            insist that Vadalis has been trying to magebreed

                                            house’s most dramatic tool, but Orien runs caravans and coaches across the
                                            length of Khorvaire. Dragonshard focus items ensure that the fastest
                                            vehicles are those driven by heirs with the Mark of Passage, but the house
                                            also licenses unmarked teamsters. The Courier’s Guild of House Orien
                                            delivers mail and packages and has a branch that handles more covert and
                                            dangerous deliveries.</p>
                                        <p>Orien has dominated transportation for centuries, but now the house is facing
                                            challenges. The Mournland is a dramatic obstacle for ground transportation,
                                            and the expanding role of Lyrandar airships threatens Orien’s business. Long
                                            distance teleportation is a service only the strongest Orien heirs can
                                            provide. Now Orien, seeking to expand its use of teleportation, is working
                                            with Cannith to find ways to unlock and enhance this ultimate gift of the
                                            Mark of Making. Orien heirs may be caught up in these experiments or in the
                                            rivalry with House Lyrandar, or they may stay close to the ground and just
                                            keep moving.</p>

                                            trade. While warriors with the Mark of Sentinel are among its most elite
                                            forces, House Deneith brokers the services of a wide range of soldiers,
                                            including Valenar warbands and the goblins of Droaam. Beyond the

                                            who can afford their services. House Deneith is also renowned for
                                            its&nbsp;<strong>Sentinel Marshals</strong>, agents that hold the authority
                                            to pursue criminals and enforce the law across the length of Khorvaire. The
                                            Sentinel Marshals hold the honor of the house in their hands. Being a

                                        <p>The Dragonmarked Houses aren’t allowed to own land or hold noble titles.
                                            House Deneith has always abided by these edicts, maintaining absolute
                                            neutrality and selling its services to all sides of a conflict. However,
                                            there’s a faction that feels that Deneith should use its power for its own
                                            purposes, not just in the service of others. House Deneith is also caught in
                                            an escalating rivalry with House Tharashk, which is edging into the
